🚀 Wikipedia Search Engine
Welcome to my Wikipedia Search Engine, a fast and lightweight web app that allows users to search for Wikipedia articles dynamically! Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project fetches search results in real-time using an API and presents them in a clean, user-friendly format.

🌟 Features
✅ Instant Search – Just type and hit Enter to get results instantly.
✅ API Integration – Fetches search results dynamically from Wikipedia.
✅ Spinner Animation – Displays a loading spinner while fetching results.
✅ Responsive UI – Works smoothly on all screen sizes.
✅ Optimized Performance – Uses debouncing to minimize unnecessary API calls.

🔧 Technologies Used
HTML – For structuring the UI
CSS – For styling and responsiveness
JavaScript (ES6) – For handling API calls and DOM manipulation
Fetch API – For making asynchronous requests
🎯 How It Works
Enter a search term in the input field.
